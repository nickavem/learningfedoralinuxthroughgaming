## So You Want to Play Games On Linux?

Just a few years ago, you would have sounded mad saying something like this. Throughout most of its life, Linux was never designed for, or even remotely supported *any* games outside those developed by individuals within the community, and games with \*free licensing that could be easily ported over.

> **\*"Free"** will refer to [Software Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement) in this guide. Software that costs nothing will be reffered to as "freeware," "free as in beer," "$0," or any other term denoting no monetary cost, rather than the freedom to run the software for any purpose as well as to study, change, and distribute.
