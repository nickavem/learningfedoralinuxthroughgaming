# LFLTG TODO

This page will be divided into 3 subcategories: Needs To Be Done Now, Needs To Be Done Later, Might Need To Be Done. While it is not imperative that you follow this order, if you want something to do, it may be a good guideline to follow.

*Completed and old items should be moved below newer ones for ease of access. Dates will be in the MM/DD/YY format.*
